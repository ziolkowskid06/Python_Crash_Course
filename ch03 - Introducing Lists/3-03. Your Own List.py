"""
Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples.
Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”
"""

my_list = ['Ducati', 'audi', 'bmw']
print(f"I don't like {my_list[0]} motorcycle.")
print(f"My dreamest car is {my_list[1].title()} R8!")
print(f"But first, I need to buy old {my_list[2].upper()}.")
